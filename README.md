# PiRA zero 
## Power in Responsive Applications HAT for Raspberry Pi with RTC for power saving mode
PiRa zero is a compact shield for power scheduling on Rasppbery Pi and similar devices in solar and wirelessly powered applications. It implements the following key features:

## Features

 * single cell LiPo cell charging of up to 3A (multiple 18650 cells supported)
 * solar panel charging (Voltaic systems 6W panels in parallel recommended)
 * USB charging, compatible with QI wireless chargers
 * advanced current limiting, to support wide array of chargers
 * precise charging control via i2c (BQ24296)
 * battery temperature protection with thermistor
 * battery reverse polarity protection and fuse (3A)
 * advancerd power scheduling for robust applications
  * power timer TPL5110 for configurable scheduled boot 1s-7200s or one-time power up on charging
  * RTC DS3231 for configurable scheduled boot and timekeeping
  * configurable power-up sources
   * power-up on charging
   * power-up from power timer
   * power-up from RTC
   * power-up from self-enable (cpu signal)
 * high-current battery output mosfet (for 3G or satellite modems)
 * 5V regulated output enabled from timing sources
 * LORA RMF95 communication module
 * battery voltage precise measurement (MCP3021)
